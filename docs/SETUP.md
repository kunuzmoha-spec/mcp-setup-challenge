# MCP Setup (VS Code)

## What I did
- Initialized a Git repository
- Created AI agent instructions file
- Connected repository to GitHub and pushed successfully

## What worked
- Git initialization and commits
- Remote setup and push after authentication

## What didn’t work / issues
- Git Credential Manager error (`string binding is invalid`)
- Resolved via browser authentication
- MCP server initialization was attempted, but the Tenx proxy returned a 404 during metadata fetch, causing the server to exit before initialization.


## Current status
- Repo is public and up to date
- Ready for further MCP configuration
